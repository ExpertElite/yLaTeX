# yLectureNote

This class is meant for taking lecture note. It aims mainly scientific classes but can surely be used for other subjects.

## Showcase

A showcase of this template can be seen in the [example directory](../../examples/yLectureNote).

## Prerequisites

For this class to work, you will need to compile it using XeLaTeX, have the infoBulle package installed (see this repo's 'yPackages' folder) and all the 'fonts' in the font package available. Please also note that the fontawesome font, needed by the infoBulle package, causes often problems (installation name, postscript name, file name can all be different...). Don't hesitate to redefine the '\FA' font family with fontspec to match your fontawesome file name.

## Work in Progress

This class is an open source project. It was designed to fullfil my needs. I am glad to share it but won't add code that I don't need. In that respect, the docunmentation doesn't cover all the class possibilities (the ones to change the school logo for example) and it is only translated in French, English and German. If you want to improve it, I would be a great pleasure to accept your help! 

## Documentation

The documentation file is expressively meant to be short (~1 page recto-verso), so that one can print it, use it, loose ite, reprint it, etc. Its briefness is also the key to rapidly finding the needed code. The down side of this, is that an unexperienced user will probably have diffuculties at the beginning as I assume the reader has a pretty good understanding of the LaTeX mechanisms.
