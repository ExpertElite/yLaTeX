  Open source software has become a crucial infrastructure in contemporary societies which is why it is important to protect it.
  This work aims to design blockchain primitives that make open source \strong{trustless}.
  We explore a key element of trustlessness: \strong{decentralization}; why we care about it, and how to achieve it.
  The main proposal of this work is a voting system based on \strong{tokens with time-decreasing power}, which opens a new design space for voting systems, including creating incentives for recurrent contributions and lowering power entrenchment.
  Additionally, we propose a \strong{rewarding scheme} to define the power of the tokens that should be awarded for contributions to an open source project, as well as a \strong{strategy to distribute the money} received by the project to its contributors using the same tokens, aligning value creation and value extraction.
  We propose a \strong{voting workflow} specifically targeted at merge requests that improves security, by providing a challenge mechanism that deters adversarial proposals.
  Finally, we propose a scheme to \strong{back issues} with money for improved community feedback.
  All these features build a coherent specification, called \strong{GitDAO}, that improves the guarantees provided by any open source project that uses it.
