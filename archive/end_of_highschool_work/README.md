# TM

## General Description
I made this document mainly during the summer 2015.
It is the end-of-high-school document I had to wrote.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this document uses an old version of infoBulle that I do not possess anymore (written before I started using Git...) and is therefor **not compilable**! (One could however change all the calls to the infoBulle package so that they would match the new version and the document would become compilable.)

It is left only as an example!
Almost all design elements found in my TM can be found elsewhere on this repo (and many of them were since then improved)!
